/*

 description of the central unit of the mem controller:
 It contains a fsm that states how the controller behaves:
 when to look for data into the driver's status register
 when to look for data in the driver's Rx FIFO
 when to request to the memory data, so that it would be sent to the driver's Tx FIFO

 it will contain a counter, used when writing data into the memory
 it will have a frequency divider, so that the current consumption would be lowered (also used to not ask every clock cycle for data in the status register)
 it will ensure that the data received from the driver is properly translated, based on the command-byte given
