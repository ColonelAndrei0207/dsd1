/*

 description of the i/o block towards the memory;

 it will act based on the info received from the main fsm:
 it will receive a code that states in which memory we are writing (instruction or data)
 	the code will also state if a write operation or a read operation is done
 it will receive the starting address in which it will write
 	based on the given address and the length of the data, it will increment the address
